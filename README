# DeepStream Vehicle and Pedestrian Detection & Classification

This project leverages NVIDIA DeepStream on the Jetson Nano to perform real-time detection and classification of vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and bicycles. The application also categorizes detected vehicles by type using dedicated secondary models.

## Objective
- Detect and classify vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and bicycles.
- Classify vehicles by type (e.g., SUV, sedan) using NVIDIA DeepStream.

## Models Used

### 1. Primary GIE (PGIE) Model
- **Model**: ResNet10
- **Labels**: Car, Bicycle, Person, RoadSign
- **Configuration Details**:
  - **Network Mode**: INT8
  - **Batch Size**: 1

### 2. Secondary GIEs (SGIE) Model
- **Purpose**: Vehicle Type Classification
- **Model**: ResNet18
- **Labels**: Coupe, Large Vehicle, Sedan, SUV, Truck, Van
- **Configuration Details**:
  - **Network Mode**: INT8
  - **Batch Size**: 16

## Interface
The application interface displays the processed video on-screen, showing detected objects in real-time.

## Summary of Features
This DeepStream pipeline processes post-tracking metadata, iterating through tracked objects and outputting key information, including:

- **Object Identifiers**: Unique IDs for each object
- **Object Types**: Class labels such as vehicle or pedestrian
- **Object Locations**: Bounding box coordinates
- **Confidence Levels**: Confidence scores for each detected object

## Requirements
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano
- **Software**: DeepStream SDK 6.0, Python 3.x
